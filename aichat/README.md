# README

These are config files for my personal usage of AICHAT : <https://github.com/sigoden/aichat>

Especially in combination with Orange [LLM Proxy](https://portal.llmproxy.ai.orange).

## Installation of Aichat and of these config files

On Mac OS
``` bash
brew install aichat
make config.yaml
ln -s ~/dotfiles/aichat/config.yaml ./config.yaml
```


Also have  a look at roles defined by me here : [roles folder](./roles/README.md)
